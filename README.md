Insights into the code and how to run it using Visual Studio (Windows):

->First step is to open the project in Visual Studio

Insights:

->This retrieves upto 5 followers of a github account

string apiUrl = "https://api.github.com/users/USERID/followers?per_page=5"; apiUrl = apiUrl.Replace("USERID", userid);

->Web Request :

request.Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.Authorization, "Basic " + Convert.ToBase64String(System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes("Username:Password")));

Username:Password Here pass in username and password of your GitHub account

->After the http call is made, api response will be retreived in JSON format,converted to datatable and this data will be looped in and the function will be called to retreive the data upto 3 levels deep(upto 5 followers of each github account)

->Build and start the project

You can get data upto 3 levels deep(upto 5 followers of each github account) : Route : /api/Followers/GetFollowers/{id}
